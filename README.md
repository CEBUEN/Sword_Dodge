**Sword Dodge** is a fast-paced mobile game developed in Unity where you play as a teapot-themed character dodging swords falling from the sky. The objective is simple—survive as long as possible by tapping the left or right side of the screen to move and double-tapping to dash. Sword Dodge combines lighthearted visuals with reactive gameplay, offering a fun and challenging experience for all ages.

The game is built using **Unity** and scripted in **C#**, featuring custom mobile input handling that differentiates between single taps and double taps using `TouchPhase` detection. Unity’s **physics system** drives the sword movement, while **object pooling** ensures optimized performance across Android devices. The **UI system** is used to manage score display, retry buttons, and gameplay feedback, all presented in portrait orientation for a seamless mobile experience.

Assets were created and polished using **Adobe Photoshop** and **Clip Studio Paint**, with sound effects edited in **Audacity**. The project is structured with modular scripts for player control, enemy spawning, and game state management—making it easy to expand with new features like power-ups, hazards, or cosmetics. Sword Dodge is currently available for Android and was tested across multiple devices using Unity Remote and local APK builds.

### How to Play

* **Tap left or right** on the screen to move the character in that direction.
* **Double-tap** to quickly dash and reposition to avoid fast-falling swords.
* Survive for as long as possible to increase your score.
